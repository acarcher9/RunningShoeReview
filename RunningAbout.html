    <h2 class="header">Origins</h2>
    <p class="body">Founded in 2005 by two sisters, our blog was originated by Annie and Emily while they trained for their first marathon! They discovered that they needed help picking out shoes as they trained, but they struggled to find a community of runners who could discuss their favorite brands, pros and cons, and experiences without influence from companies. </p>
